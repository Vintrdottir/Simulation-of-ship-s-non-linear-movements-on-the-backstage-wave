An explicit differential equation describing the side rocking from the given extortion was solved with numerical method - Fourth Order Runge - Kutta technique. 

Depending on the amplitude and frequency of the heeling moment, the amplitudes of the ship's motion were determined.

The results are presented in the form of resonance curves.

F.m is a function file used by the main program. Both must be running for correct operation.
